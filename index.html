        <p class="tab">My name is Claire Stolp and I'm a web developer based in Raleigh, North Carolina. I have taken a somewhat windy road to development but the sum of these experiences are what make me who I am as a developer. I went to college for music education, learned Japanese, then went on to teach English in Japan for four years. It was in Japan that I stumbled upon web development. It was certainly a wild ride, but these are important life experiences that continue to inspire me and my code today.

        <p class="tab">
          As a developer, I believe that from front to back web applications should be both inspired and intuitive. I strive to make applications that combine just the right amount of convention and invention to draw the user into the experience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="tab">
          I am currently attending UNC Chapel Hill's Coding Boot Camp, a full stack web development program that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the MERN software stack. Other technologies covered in the course include C#, ASP.NET, SEO and MySQL. Graduation is anticipated October, 2018.
